### Hello World!ðŸŒŽ

I'm Samuel, a Software Engineer based in United States.<br/>

I love creating tools and referencing existing technologies to improve my skills.<br/>

Outside of code, you'll find me studying, hitting the gym, or drawing. Coding wise, I mainly build projects for learning purposes and to help beginners like myself, improve.<br/>

**Fun Facts:**<br/>
- I'm a digital artist<br/>
- Spiderman into the Spiderverse is my favorite movie<br/>
