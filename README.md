### Hello World!👍

I'm Samuel, a Software Engineer based in United States.<br/> <!-- Add linken onto my name-->

I love creating tools and referencing existing technologies to improve my skills.<br/>

Outside of code, you'll find me studying, hitting the gym, or drawing. Coding wise, I mainly build projects for learning purposes and to help beginners like myself, improve.<br/>
